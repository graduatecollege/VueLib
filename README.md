# Graduate College Vue Packages

This is an npm workspaces monorepo containing shared Vue 3 packages
that don't contain components. Components are in the [grad-vue](https://github.com/graduatecollege/grad-vue)
project.

These packages are mainly meant for Graduate College internal use.
That being said, it's open source, and you're welcome to use it.

## Packages

- [`@graduatecollege/vue-auth`](packages/vue-auth)
- [`@graduatecollege/vue-useful-api`](packages/vue-useful-api)
- [`@graduatecollege/vue-datetime`](packages/vue-datetime)
- [`@graduatecollege/codex`](packages/codex)

## Development

### Initial Setup

Install all dependencies for all packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building Packages

Build all packages at once from the root:

```

### Using Packages Locally

To use these packages locally before publishing:

1. Build all packages from the root:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Use `npm link`:

   npm link
